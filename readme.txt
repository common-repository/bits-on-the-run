The JW Platform plugin for WordPress provided publishers with the ability to

the WordPress CMS. Video uploads and embeds could be performed directly within the Wordpress post / page editor. This custom plugin was built by
the creators of the JW Player. It provided users with an easy way to manage and embed their videos - hosted in JW Platform - and publish them to WordPress, using the JW Player.
